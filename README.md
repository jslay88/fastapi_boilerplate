    mv fastapi_boilerplate my_project
    cd my_project
    git remote remove origin

## Loose Ends
### Auth and Tokens
You really do not want to put any sort of token within the code itself.
Ideally, you would read some file from disk that is either mounted to 
the container or downloaded with the `prestart.sh` script and 
register your tokens using `APITokens.regsiter_token` from `app.utils.auth`. 

This has purposefully be left this way to make you understand the simplicity 
being used here, and up to you to improve upon, or replace this method all together.
